## How to Use

This library is structured for use with Obsidian, but the prompts are plain Markdown files, making them universally accessible.

*   **Clone the Repository:** The entire library can be cloned from its GitHub repository.
*   **Browse Individual Prompts:** Navigate the directories to find specific `.md` files for each prompt.
*   **Explore the Knowledge Base:** For a comprehensive overview and navigation, please see the [main index file](index.md).
*   **Understand the Framework:** To get the most out of these prompts, review the [Cervia Blueprint](Meta%20Prompts/cervia-blueprint.md), which explains the underlying structure and design principles.

(Note: If you are viewing this on GitHub, `[main index file](index.md)` and other internal links might not resolve directly. Please clone the repository and open it in Obsidian or a compatible Markdown editor for the full experience, or navigate to `index.md` manually.)
